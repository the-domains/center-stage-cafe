Center Stage Café 

The opening weekend of Center Stage Café was a huge success! HART Theatre has turned the Main Stage into a café for the 2016 Studio Season. Guests can make reservations and dine at Center Stage Café, which opens and hour and a half before each performance. _**Love, Loss, and What I Wore, **_opened  the Studio Season with sold out crowds, and the café was filled to capacity each night of the opening weekend. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b3b10937-77bc-43de-87fd-533b111b0e37.jpg)
