Center Stage Café 

The opening weekend of Center Stage Café was a huge success! HART Theatre has turned the Main Stage into a café for the 2016 Studio Season. Guests can make reservations and dine at Center Stage Café, which opens and hour and a half before each performance. _**Love, Loss, and What I Wore, **_opened  the Studio Season with sold out crowds, and the café was filled to capacity each night of the opening weekend.
